# Genre
	Point Collecting Game

# Project Description 
This Project honestly inspired by guitar hero gameplay. I add more lanes and free camera to make it more challenging for players.
Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief
	There will be 4 lanes that will keep spawning “enemies” and gain scores when you hit them on target. You can move around your camera so you can have better view of the lanes.
	
# Targeted platforms
	- Web-Based

# Project Scope 
	The project is quiet simple and probably can take up to 2 months to be finished and perfected it but the core gameplay is probably take weeks to be good and smooth. I am alone in the project (Darrian Jovan-1901521293). In this project I am using the standard library for babylonJS which is Babylon.js and BabylonOBJImporter.js and also xampp to create a “server” for the game to run
